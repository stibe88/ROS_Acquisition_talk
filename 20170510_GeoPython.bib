abstract = {Portable laser range-finders, further referred to as LIDAR, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are an efficient method of acquiring as-built floor plans. Generating and visualizing floor plans in real-time helps the operator assess the quality and coverage of capture data. Build- ing a portable capture platform necessitates operating under limited computational resources.We present the approach used in our backpack mapping platform which achieves real-time mapping and loop closure at a 5cm resolution. To achieve real- time loop closure, we use a branch-and-bound approach for computing scan-to-submap matches as constraints. We provide experimental results and comparisons to other well known approaches which show that, in terms of quality, our approach is competitive with established techniques.},

abstract = {This paper gives an overview of ROS, an open- source robot operating system. ROS is not an operating system in the traditional sense of process management and scheduling; rather, it provides a structured communications layer above the host operating systems of a heterogenous compute cluster. In this paper, we discuss how ROS relates to existing robot software frameworks, and briefly overview some of the available application software which uses ROS},

@article{Burkhard2012,
abstract = {In this paper we introduce a state-of-the-art stereovision mobile mapping system with different stereo imaging sensors and present a series of performance tests carried out with this system. The aim of these empirical tests was to investigate different performance aspects under real-world conditions. The investigations were carried out with different cameras and camera configurations in order to determine their potential and limitations for selected application scenarios. In brief the test set consists of investigations in geometric accuracy, in radiometric image quality and in the extraction of 3d point clouds using dense matching algorithms. The first tests resulted in an absolute overall 3d accuracy of 4-5 cm depending mainly on the quality of the navigation system used for direct georeferencing. The relative point measurement accuracy was approx. 2 cm and 1 cm for the 2 megapixel and the 11 megapixel sensors respectively. In the second series of investigations we present results obtained by applying tone mapping algorithms often used for high dynamic range images (HDR). In our third series of tests refinements of the radiometric calibration of the stereo system and corrections of the vignetting resulted in an improved completeness of the depth map on the roadside environment. We conclude the paper with investigations in obtaining complete and accurate depth maps for a robust and accurate 3d monoplotting support in vision-based mobile mapping web services. For this we present first results obtained by interpolating incomplete areas in the disparity maps and by fusing the disparity maps with additional LiDAR data.},
